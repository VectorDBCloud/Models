## About

This repository serves as a centralized resource for finding and sharing machine learning models that integrate seamlessly with vector databases. The curated models are selected based on their performance and compatibility with vector database technologies, enabling developers to enhance their applications with advanced AI capabilities.

## How to Contribute

We encourage contributions from the community! If you have a model that works well with vector databases or enhancements to existing models, please contribute by following these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Add Your Model**: Create a new directory for your model. Include any scripts, model weights, and a README with instructions and use cases.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: After adding your model, submit a pull request for review and inclusion in the repository.

### Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure that all models are properly licensed and attributed.
- Include comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions, usage examples, and any dependencies.
- Clearly state the purpose and potential applications of the model.

## Models

### Text Embeddings

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**  
  *Description*: A transformer-based model designed for various NLP tasks, including semantic search and question answering.
