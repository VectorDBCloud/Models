## About

This repository serves as a centralized resource for finding and sharing machine learning models that integrate seamlessly with vector databases. The curated models are selected based on their performance and compatibility with vector database technologies, enabling developers to enhance their applications with advanced AI capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Knowledge of machine learning and vector databases
- Familiarity with Hugging Face's transformers library
- Access to vector database systems (e.g., pgvector, Milvus, Qdrant, ChromaDB)

## Models

### Text Embeddings

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**  
  *Description*: A transformer-based model designed for various NLP tasks, including semantic search and question answering.  
  *Link*: [BERT on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased)

- **SBERT (Sentence-BERT)**  
  *Description*: An extension of BERT optimized for generating high-quality sentence embeddings, ideal for clustering and semantic search.

### Image Embeddings

- **ResNet (Residual Networks)**  
  *Description*: A popular deep learning model used for image recognition tasks, suitable for generating image embeddings.  
  *Link*: [ResNet on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50)

- **CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining)**  
  *Description*: A model capable of understanding images and text together, useful for multimodal applications.
